#  Write a method perfect_square? that accepts a number as an argument. 
#  The method should return a boolean indicating whether or not the argument is a perfect 
#  square.
#  A perfect square is a number that is the product of some number multiplied by itself. 
#  For example, since 64 = 8 * 8 and 144 = 12 * 12, 64 and 144 are perfect squares; 35 is 
#  not a perfect square.

        return true if  i * i == num
        i += 1
